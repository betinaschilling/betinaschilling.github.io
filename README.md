# piazzai.github.io

These are the source files of my personal website, built using a slightly customized version of the [hacked-jekyll](https://github.com/piazzai/hacked-jekyll) theme. I use it to link my online profiles, host my CV, and distribute course materials.

Because of its inclusion in a fork network, this repository was lucky enough to be added to the 2020 GitHub snapshot for the [Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault) program. While I am happy that this small description of me will be preserved forever, I sincerely apologize to future archeologists for the opportunity cost of space.
