These are the source files of my personal website, built using a customized version of Bootstrap's [cover](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/cover/) theme. I use it to link my online profiles, host my CV, and occasionally, distribute course materials to my students.

Because of its inclusion in a fork network, this repository was lucky enough to be added to the 2020 GitHub snapshot for the [Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault) program. While I am happy that this small description of myself will be preserved forever, I apologize to future archeologists for the waste of time and space.
